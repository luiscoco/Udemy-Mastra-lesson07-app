# Mastra · Lesson 07 · Building and Registering Your First Agent

Resolve a real agent by registry key or stable ID, inspect its identity, and invoke it only after provider setup is ready.

![Lesson 07 application](docs/application-preview.png)

## What this application does

Try the registry key and the agent ID as different lookup methods. A source module alone does not make an agent available to the runtime.

**Practical mode:** Actual Mastra agent registration and lookup · no model call.

The local lab really resolves the registered agent. No tools, persistent memory or authentication system are added to this minimal first-agent example. Provider inference occurs only in live mode.

## Run the application

Use **Node.js 24+**. Each lesson is an independent repository with its own dependency lockfile.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/luiscoco/Udemy-Mastra-lesson07-app.git
cd Udemy-Mastra-lesson07-app
npm ci
npm start
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:3207** and choose **Run practical lab**. The practical operation requires no model key. Starting the server does not make a provider request. Keep the terminal open; Ctrl+C stops it. To change the port, set PORT in the environment or local .env file.

## Application pages

| Page | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Application lab | Editable JSON cases, actual execution, formatted result, event log and structured metadata |
| What you will learn | Lesson objectives, comprehension checks and a concrete exercise |
| How to run | Installation, local/live modes, commands and troubleshooting |
| Architecture & workflow | The practical execution sequence and the actual request runner |
| Code walkthrough | Source-derived excerpts with GitHub line references |

The application supports light/dark themes, mobile layouts, sanitized Markdown, syntax-highlighted code and copy-code controls.

## Practical execution workflow

| Stage | Source | Actual behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Validate reference | [src/lab.ts](src/lab.ts) | Choose lookupBy=key or lookupBy=id with a bounded reference string. |
| Inspect registry | [src/mastra/index.ts](src/mastra/index.ts) | Register the agent under firstAgent. |
| Resolve identity | [src/lab.ts](src/lab.ts) | Call getAgent() for a matching registry key or getAgentById() for a matching stable id. |
| Return public identity | [src/lab.ts](src/lab.ts) | Show registry key, stable id, display name and lookup outcome. |

The browser posts JSON to **POST /api/lab**. The host validates the envelope, runs the lesson implementation and sends NDJSON events. The UI renders the actual result and a separate application outcome. **GET /api/config** exposes public lesson metadata and credential-presence readiness, never credential values.

## Classroom cases and expected outcomes

### 1. Resolve the registry key

```json
{
  "lookupBy": "key",
  "agentRef": "firstAgent"
}
```

**Expected:** The registered agent's actual ID and name.

### 2. Use an ID as a key

```json
{
  "lookupBy": "key",
  "agentRef": "lesson-seven-first-agent"
}
```

**Expected:** A lookup finding explaining the key/ID distinction.

### 3. Resolve the stable ID

```json
{
  "lookupBy": "id",
  "agentRef": "lesson-seven-first-agent"
}
```

**Expected:** The same registered agent through getAgentById.

## Interpreting the result

- firstAgent is the registry key; lesson-seven-first-agent is the stable id.
- Using the stable id with lookupBy=key produces Needs attention.
- Exporting an Agent is separate from registering it in the Mastra instance.

**Complete** means the operation met its implemented completion checks. **Needs attention** exposes a business, format or validation finding. **Could not finish** is an execution/request failure. **Cancelled** is a separate user action. Read the evidence before treating any runtime status as task correctness.

## Optional live-agent workflow

1. Resolve the chosen agent before making any model request.
2. Only a successful resolution proceeds to the actual agent.generate() call.

The live button uses **POST /api/query** and a real provider, and may incur API usage. Tests use an explicit SDK model adapter; no paid provider call is claimed by the test evidence.

Configure your own credentials locally, preserving any existing .env:

```powershell
if (!(Test-Path .env)) { Copy-Item .env.example .env }
notepad .env
```

```dotenv
# Set your own provider credential locally. No credential is copied from another app.
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
MASTRA_MODEL=openai/gpt-4.1-mini
PORT=3207
```

Choose a model your account can access and restart the server. Credentials remain on the host and are ignored by Git. Existing shell values take precedence over the optional .env file. Provider/model availability and supported parameters must be checked for your selected model.

## Build, samples and verification

```powershell
npm run sample
npm run build
npm test
npm run test:browser
```

- **sample:** executes the default practical case without a provider key.
- **sample:live:** runs an actual provider request after configuration; invoke separately with npm run sample:live.
- **build:** regenerates all five pages, actual-source excerpts, architecture SVG, this README and the browser bundle.
- **test:** typechecks and runs offline local-operation, invalid-input, cancellation, real-SDK adapter, generated-content and HTTP-boundary checks, plus lesson-specific regression cases.
- **test:browser:** uses isolated headless Chrome to execute the real practical lab and its failure case, verify all five pages and mobile layout, check theme persistence, syntax colors and safe Markdown, and save [browser evidence](docs/browser-qa.json). The live-renderer fixture makes no provider request.

Set BROWSER_EXECUTABLE if Chrome/Chromium is not installed at the platform’s standard path. Browser tests are local; GitHub Actions runs npm ci, build and the offline test suite.

## Dependencies

| Runtime package | Pinned version |
| --- | --- |
| @mastra/core | 1.81.0 |
| dompurify | 3.4.17 |
| marked | 18.1.3 |
| zod | 4.6.7 |

The committed package-lock.json fixes the installed dependency tree. A remote model alias is independent of the JavaScript lockfile.

## Student exercise

Change the display name and inspect whether the key and stable ID change. Then use the wrong lookup method and diagnose the result before changing credentials.

Rebuild after a source change so the explanation pages, line references and README remain consistent with the running code.
